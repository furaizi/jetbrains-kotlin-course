package module_4.OOP.OOP_in_Kotlin

/*
Every class is "public" and "final" by default
Mark it as "open" if you want to allow inheritance

"internal" - visible in the same module
"protected" - visible in the class and its subclasses
"private" class member - visible in the class
"private" top-level declaration - visible in the file
Under the hood, "internal" is public, but obfuscates a method name

Module is a set of Kotlin files compiled together
- an IDEA module
- a Maven project
- a Gradle source set

In Kotlin you can put several classes into one file
